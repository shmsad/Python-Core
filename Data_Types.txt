Data Types:- A Data type represent the type of data stored into a variable or
memory. The Data types which are already available in python language are called 
Built-in datatypes. The data type wich can be created by programmers are called 
User-defined data types.

Built-in Data types:
None type:- the None Type data type represent an object that dose not contain any 
value.

Numeric type:- int, float, complex.

Bool Data types:-There are only two boolean values True or False that can be represent 
by this data type.

Serquence type:- str, bytes, bytearray, list, tuple, range

Sets :-1) A set is unordered collection of elements much like a set in mathematics.The
order elements is not maintained in the sets. 
Frozenset:-2) The frozenset datatype is same as the set datatype. the main deifference 
is that elements in the set data type can be modified. whereas the elements of frozenset
can not be modified.

Mapping:-The dict datatype is an example for the map. The dict represent a dictionary 
that contains pairs of elements such that the first elements reperesent the key and the 
next one becomes its value.

Literals in python:- A literal is a constant value that is stored into a variable in a 
program. 
a = 15 :- a is a variable and = is an operator and 15 is an literal
types of literals:- 
Numeric literals
Boolean literals
String literals
