Introduction Of python:- Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the year 1991.
python is high level programming language that contains features of functional programming 
language like C and object oriented programming language like java.

Python virtual machine(PVM) is the software containing an interpreter that converts 
the byte code into machine code. This byte code is given to Python Virtual Machine
which converts the byte code into machine code so that the processor will execute it and

Memory manager is a module (or sub progaramm) in PVM which will allocate mermory for 
objects. Garbage collector is another module in PVM that will deallocate (or free) memory 
for unused object.
